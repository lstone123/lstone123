## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Louise!

I'm a **Le Wagon** Full Stack Web Developer graduate, where I studied Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Postgresql, OOP and MVC architecture models and more.

Currently, I'm working at Le Wagon as a lead teacher and batch manager, and doing further study in JavaScript, React + React Native and Python. I'm keen to learn more and progress as a software engineer. 

I love a puzzle and anything logical / problem solving based! My other interests are art ðŸŽ¨, music ðŸŽ¶ and design. 

Feel free to reach out! You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/l-stone/)
